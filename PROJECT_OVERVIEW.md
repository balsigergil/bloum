# Project Overview

**Bloum Overview**: Bloum is a modern, lightweight web components library developed by Gil Balsiger that provides a comprehensive set of accessible, framework-agnostic UI components for web applications. The library is specifically designed to fullfill the need of modern components when working with traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), with a focus on server-side rendering frameworks like Laravel, Django, and Rails. Its core value propositions include accessibility-first design with WAI-ARIA compliance, lightweight architecture for fast loading times, and seamless integration with HTMX.

**Technical Architecture**: The library employs a hybrid architecture combining CSS-only components for simple UI elements, and JavaScript enhancement for advanced functionality. Built with TypeScript and modern tooling including Vite, Storybook, Playwright, and ESLint, Bloum uses a centralized initialization system for the JavaScript and a styling architecture with CSS layers and custom properties for theming. The build process generates multiple distribution formats (ESM, CommonJS, IIFE) with full TypeScript declarations.

**Integration and Positioning**: Bloum is designed for seamless integration with server-side frameworks, HTMX and Tailwind. The library uniquely positions itself in the web components ecosystem by addressing the needs of traditional web applications while embracing modern development practices, making it an attractive choice for projects seeking to enhance user interfaces without significant architectural changes. It provides a great alternative to Bootstrap.
