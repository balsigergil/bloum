# Introduction

## What is Bloum?

Bloum is an open-source library of unstyled web components. The goal of this library is to provide a set of components that can be used in any web project, regardless of the framework or library used.
It implements the most common components used in web applications that required a lot of JavaScript to work, like select, tabs, modals, etc.

It is unstyled by default, meaning that it doesn't provide an opinionated design. It is up to you to style the components to fit your needs. However, it comes with a theme that you can use to get started quickly.

## Why Bloum?

The goal for this library is not to provide an exhaustive list of components, but rather to provider components that are usually tedious to implement and require a lot of JavaScript to work.

## Installation

### CDN

You can use the following lines in your `head` tag to load the latest version of Bloum from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bloum" defer></script>

<!-- include the default unstyled stylesheet -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/bloum/dist/style.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- include the modern theme -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/bloum/dist/modern.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Package manager


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
    ```bash
    npm install bloum
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add bloum
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpm add bloum
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="Bun">
    ```bash
    bun add bloum
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once installed, you can import the library in your JavaScript project:

```js
import "bloum"
```

This will register all the components globally.

After that, you can include the default unstyled stylesheet in your JavaScript if you're using a bundler like Vite or Webpack:

```js
import "bloum/dist/style.min.css"
```

If you want to use an already styled theme, you can include it too:

```js
import "bloum/dist/modern.min.css"
```

Then, you can use the components in your HTML:

```html
<bl-select name="my-select">
  <div data-value="1">Option 1</div>
  <div data-value="2">Option 2</div>
  <div data-value="3">Option 3</div>
</bl-select>
```
