## What is Bloum?

Bloum is an open-source library of web components. The goal of this library is to provide a set of CSS and JavaScript components that can be used in any web project, regardless of the framework or library used.

The main use-case for Bloum is to provide easy-to-use components for projects using MPA (Multi-Page Application) architectures like Laravel, Django, or Rails. It pairs particularly well with server-side rendering and progressive enhancement tools like [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
